Volume is trading activity over a period of time. Usually, the dollar volume is the volume measure, which is the total cost of all purchasing over the period of time, usually calculated as shares times weighted average price.

Volume is generally highest at market open and close. Summary statistics for volume are often not very descriptive.

Slippage occurs when large buy or sell orders adjust the market price during their execution. Slippage is generally worse on low-volume stocks, as the time to fill orders is longer and the aggregate demand is lower.

Liquidity is subject to execution parameters, including trade size, market price, time to fill, and realized fill price. Liquidity is roughly the ability to execute trades of the desired size in a reasonable amount of time with a realized fill price near market price. This is open to interpretation and ambiguous.

Volume is not liquidity. Volume is an absolute measure of trading activity, where liquidity describes the posibility of desired trading activity. One example of a high-volume, low-liquidity market is a one-sided market, where most participants want to buy or sell. Those siding with the majority of market participants will have low liquidity.

Liquidity generally decreases with capital base and trade size, and slippage becomes greater. The upper end is constrained by liquidity. The lower end is constrained by broker fees and position errors, that is, the difficulty of meeting the desired allocation in whole shares.
